With the SAS Container Runtime (SCR) feature, SAS Intelligent Decisioning users can deploy decisions as lightweight containers.
A common question is how do you deploy these containers for testing or production use? When SAS customers move to the cloud they expect to use industry-standard, CI/CD,Â  tools for this purpose.
Deployment methods can be manual, semi-automatic, or fully automatic.

In my blog post, I explore a fully automatic approach for deploying an SCR using SAS Intelligent Decisioning, GitHub, Argo CD, and Kubernetes.
